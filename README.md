# Tipsy
Date: January 2022
Description:
This project is a simple tip calculator app called "Tipsy," built using UIKit. It allows users to calculate the amount of tip to leave based on the total bill and the desired tip percentage. Users can input their total bill, select a tip percentage, and specify how many people will share the bill, and the app will calculate how much each person owes. This project focuses on handling user input with sliders, segment controls, and text fields, while providing a dynamic interface with real-time calculations.
